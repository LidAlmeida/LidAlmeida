### Hi there!

- 🌱 I'm a biologist with PhD in Ecology and Evolution. As a scientist, I used data to answer complex questions and                communicate findings.
- 👩🏻‍🔬 I'm an observant, curious, lifelong learner, moved by challenges and now embracing a career in data science.
- 👩🏻‍💻 I’m currently learning about:
      
      Programming Languages and Database
      - Data Analyst with Python
      - SQL for data extraction
      - R for statistical modeling
      - SQLite, MySQL, Oracle, MongoDB, and Cassandra databases

      Statistics and Machine Learning
      - Descriptive statistics (location, dispersion, asymmetry, kurtosis, density)
      - Regression, classification, clustering, and learning to rank algorithms
      - Data balancing techniques, attribute selection, and reduction of
      dimensionality
      - Algorithm performance metrics ( RMSE, MAE, MAPE, Confusion Matrix, Precision, 
      Recall, ROC Curve, Lift Curve, AUC, Silhouette Score, DB-Index)
      
      Data Visualization
      - Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Bokeh
      - ggplot2, tidyverse, lattice
      - Power BI, Tableau, and Looker
